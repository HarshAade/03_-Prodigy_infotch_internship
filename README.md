Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share the projects and experiences from my internship at Prodigy Infotech. During this exciting journey, I had the opportunity to work on various data analysis and machine learning tasks. Below, you'll find an overview of the projects I completed during my internship.

## Projects

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Project Description:** In this project, I worked with the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. My goal was to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the passenger demographics and their survival rates.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Behavior Prediction**
   - **Project Description:** In this project, I built a decision tree classifier to predict customer behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. I used a dataset similar to the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

3. **Sentiment Analysis and Visualization**
   - **Project Description:** Task 3 involved analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinions and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
